## Catalyst Network Simulation
This project is to provide a simulation suite for the Catalyst Network. 

## Motivation
We split this project into three parts:
- Demonstration of security from 51% attack on the worker pools. 
- Demonstration of network latency and message propagation on the network 
- Demonstration of succesful propagation and production of peer lists during a ledger cycle to display succesful propagation. 

All of these simulations aim to allow the demonstration of the optimum parameters to be chosen when deploying the consensus mechanism demonstrated at [Insert link to Catalyst Consensus Paper]. We also demonstrate the accepted malicious node levels ($O$) that can be allowed in our network without fear of negative concequence for the network.
